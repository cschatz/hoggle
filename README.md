# Hoggle

This repo contains all relevant files for my "Hoggle" assignment for CS20/CS124 (Data Structures and Algorithms). In a variation of conventional Boggle, the human player searches for words in a hexagonal grid of letters. Once the human gives up, the AI player finds all remaining words present in the grid. To implement successfully, students must contend with multiple forms of recursive backtracking, as well as the unusual geometry of the board and leveraging a "lexicon" data structure.

The assignment specification is in the **assignment** directory.

All source code, including one pre-compiled library, is in the **src** directory.

The **SampleProgram** directory contains a sample version of the "final product" students need to build. (Please contact me if you are an instructor and want access to the source code for the completed project.)
